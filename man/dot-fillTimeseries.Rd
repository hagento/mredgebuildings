\title{Fill missing values in time series data}
\usage{
.fillTimeseries(df, extGrowthFactors = NULL, periods = 1990:2025)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing region, enduse, period, and value columns}

\item{extGrowthFactors}{A data frame containing external growth factors}

\item{periods}{Vector of time periods to include in the result (default: 1990:2025)}
}
\value{
A complete data frame with filled values for all region-enduse-period combinations
}
\description{
Fills missing values in a time series dataset using interpolation for gaps between
known values and growth-based extrapolation for extending the series.
The function uses linear interpolation between known values and calculates
appropriate growth rates for extrapolation based on available data points.
For regions with 3+ data points, it fits a log-linear model, while for
regions with 2 data points, it uses a simple growth rate calculation.
For regions within the extGrowthFactors data frame, the growth rates are used.
