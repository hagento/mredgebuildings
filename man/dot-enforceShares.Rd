\title{Enforce Shares into Energy Demand Estimates}
\usage{
.enforceShares(estimate, forceShares)
}
\arguments{
\item{estimate}{data frame with energy carrier demand estimates}

\item{forceShares}{data frame with shares to enforce for carrier-enduse combinations}
}
\value{
data frame with adjusted estimates preserving carrier totals
}
\description{
Adjusts energy demand estimates to meet specified carrier share targets
within end-uses while preserving total carrier demands. This function applies
proportional adjustments to align existing shares with target shares while
maintaining energy balance constraints. It handles missing combinations, zero
values, and special cases where target shares exist for carriers with no
historical demand. The adjustments are applied consistently across all time
periods with careful rescaling to ensure carrier totals remain unchanged.
}
\details{
Note: This function requires \code{forceShares} data to contain only one
period per region-enduse-carrier combination to work correctly.
